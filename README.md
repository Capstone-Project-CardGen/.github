 ## About The Project

![Product Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/GmRRuJe.png)

In a digital age where convenience and sustainability are critical, CardGen revolutionizes the idea of what a business card is. Offering a maintainable, environment-friendly alternative to a traditional paper business card. Books, music, and newspapers have seen their fair share of being revolutionized. What was typically seen as a physical copy has now transformed into a digital piece of media. However, business cards are still physically traded among people. Developed both for iOS and Android devices, CardGen allows users to create, share, and update their digital cards with ease. CardGen runs on many technologies, such as React Native Expo, Firebase, Python, Flask, and AWS. One of the two main features of Cardgen is our unique device-to-device clonking feature and our OCR. CardGen's “clonk” feature allows two devices to be connected for easy card sharing. This creates a simple and seamless way to network with others in a fast-paced manner. CardGen’s OCR also allows a user to scan a physical business card and import it into a digital card that can be used within the app. With CardGen, users can create personal cards that are not bound by the idea of what a business card traditionally is. Cards can also be shared to represent an event that can be easily transferred to users for birthday parties, meetings, or seminars. Ultimately, how the cards are structured is up to the user's imagination.

 ### Built With

This section should list any major frameworks/libraries used to bootstrap your project. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples.

- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs)
- [Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/)
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/)
- [AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/?nc2=h_ql_doc_ec2)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
 ## Getting Started

This project is a React Native Expo app. For more information visit, https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup. Prior to following the next steps install node.js onto your machine.
 ### Prerequisites

Install npm on your machine

- npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```
 ### Installation

- Installing React Native CLI
   ```sh
   npm install -g react-native-cli
   ```

 Cloning this project directly will NOT work, so first initialize an empty folder for React Native

   ```sh
   mkdir CardGenClone
   cd CardGenClone
   react-native init CardGen
   git clone https://github.com/Capstone-Project-CardGen/CardGen
   ```

Inserting all the commands in this section would clutter with the various download commands and dependencies, so please look at the pastebin instead.
  ```sh
  https://pastebin.com/6AfNCpFE
  ```

## To run the project
### Mac
   ```sh
   npx expo start
   or
   react-native run-ios
   ```

### Windows
```sh
npm start
```
